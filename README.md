- Fixed ACES permissions for certain LEO commands (/cuff, /drag)
- Added config options for the loadout and uniforms options
- Added fully functioning radar remote (requires my fork of WraithRS, n-wraith)

## Non-radar branch can be found by clicking branch and then radar, rather counterintuitively.
