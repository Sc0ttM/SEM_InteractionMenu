# SEM_InteractionMenu
*Multi Purpose FiveM Interaction Menu*

This resource is a menu with actions for LEO, Fire and Civ including Vehicle Controls and Emotes!

Each section has features that would be used by each of the professions, for example the LEO Menu has Cuff, Drag, Seat, etc.
Some menu features also have commands out of ease during RP.
